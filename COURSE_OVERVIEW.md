## Learning Philosophy

### **Learning by Doing**
This course emphasizes hands-on implementation. You won't just read about algorithms—you'll implement them from scratch, experiment with them, and understand why they work (or don't work).

### **Progressive Complexity**
Each level builds upon the previous one. We start simple and gradually increase complexity, ensuring you have a solid foundation before moving to advanced topics.

### **Real-World Applications**
While we cover theory, the focus is on practical applications. You'll work with real robotics simulations and learn skills that transfer to industry and research.

### **Community Learning**
Learning is collaborative. You'll work with peers, share insights, and contribute to a community of RL enthusiasts.
